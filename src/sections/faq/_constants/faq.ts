    question: "What services do you offer?",
    answer:
      "I provide end-to-end product development, including strategy, UX/UI design, full-stack engineering, MVP builds, and launch support."
  },
  {
    question: "How does your engagement process work?",
    answer:
      "I start with a short discovery call, define the scope together, outline a timeline, and begin with either a blueprint phase or direct development depending on the project."
  },
  {
    question: "What’s your typical project timeline?",
    answer:
      "Timelines vary by scope, but sprints usually run in 1–3 week cycles, and full MVPs are often completed within a few weeks."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you communicate during a project?",
    answer:
      "I keep clients updated through weekly summaries, async notes, and Loom walkthroughs for major milestones."
  },
  {
    question: "What tools and technologies do you use?",
    answer:
      "I work primarily with React, TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, Tailwind, and modern cloud infrastructure, with AI tools integrated where helpful."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide post-launch support?",
    answer:
      "Yes. I offer optional support for QA, deployment, performance fixes, and small feature improvements."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you price projects?",
    answer:
      "Pricing depends on scope and complexity. I offer flat-rate packages for common builds and retainers for longer engagements."
  },
  {
    question: "What’s your background?",
    answer:
      "I studied chemical Engineering at the University of Waterloo and found a passion for software and business development. Now I specialize in helping early-stage teams ship real products."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do you focus on end-to-end development?",
    answer:
      "My mind naturally thinks in full product cycles, so I’ve taken the time to understand every stage of development. I also believe the best products are built when design and engineering work in tight alignment."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you approach problem-solving?",
    answer:
      "prioritize clarity first. That means understanding the goal, prototyping early, and iterating based on real user needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes you different from other developers or studios?",
    answer:
      "I bring a blend of product strategy, business thinking, and full-stack engineering. Not just code execution. I approach development with an open mind and believe in removing unnecessary abstractions whenever possible."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you stay current with new technologies?",
    answer:
      "I experiment with modern frameworks, follow industry updates, and integrate new tools—especially AI—where they add real value."
  },
  {
    question: "What are your values as an engineer?",
    answer:
      "I value clarity, maintainability, open collaboration, and building products that are genuinely useful."
  },
  {
    question: "What’s your philosophy around AI in products?",
    answer:
      "AI should enhance workflows and decision-making, not replace core functionality.  It’s the muscle, not the brain."
  }
